## Introduction

Why didn't Microsoft include an IP address control in the stock toolbox for Visual Studio .NET? I needed something similar to the MFC `CIPAddressCtrl` class in a C# application recently, and was forced to roll my own. I tried to mimic the behavior of `CIPAddressCtrl` using C#, and hopefully I've succeeded.

If you need a C# IPv6 address control or a C# MAC address control, take a look at [this project](https://github.com/m66n/flexfieldcontrollib).

## Background

`IPAddressControl` is a `ContainerControl` that aggregates four specialized `TextBox` controls of type `FieldCtrl` and three specialized Controls of type `DotCtrl`.

The `FieldCtrl`s do some validation and keyboard filtering in addition to standard `TextBox` behavior. The `DotCtrl`s do nothing but draw a dot. 

## Using the Code

Once the library containing `IPAddressControl` (*IPAddressControlLib.dll*) is built, add the control to the Toolbox in Visual Studio. From the Toolbox, just drag the control onto a form and you're ready to go.

NB: When using this code with .NET Framework 4, the WinForms application should target ".NET Framework 4" rather than the default ".NET Framework 4 Client Profile."

The interface to IPAddressControl is very simple.

### Public Instance Properties

* `AnyBlank`: Gets whether any fields in the control are blank.
* `AutoHeight`: Gets or sets a value indicating whether the control is sized according to the current font and border. Default value is `true`.
* `Blank`: Gets a value indicating whether all of the fields in the control are empty.
* `BorderStyle`: Gets or sets the border style of the control. Default value is `BorderStyle.Fixed3D`.
* `IPAddress`: Gets or sets an `IPAddress` representing the contents of the fields. (VS2010 only)
* `ReadOnly`: Gets or sets a value indicating if the control is read-only.

### Public Instance Methods

* `Clear`: Clears the contents of the control.
* `GetAddressBytes`: Returns an array of bytes representing the contents of the fields, index `0` being the leftmost field.
* `SetAddressBytes`: Sets the values of the fields using an array of bytes, index `0` being the leftmost field.
* `SetFieldFocus`: Sets the keyboard focus to the specified field in the control.
* `SetFieldRange`: Sets the lower and higher range of a specified field in the control.

The above properties and methods are in addition to the stock properties and methods of `UserControl`. Stock properties such as `Text`, `Enabled`, and `Font`, as well as stock methods such as `ToString()` work as expected.

Client code can register a handler for the public event, `FieldChangedEvent`, to be notified when any text in the fields of the control changes.

Note that `Text` and `ToString()` may not return the same value. If there are any empty fields in the control, `Text` will return a value that will reflect the empty fields. `ToString()` will fill in any empty field with that field's `RangeLower` value. Also, if you are using the control to create an `IPAddress`, you can easily do so using this control's `GetAddressBytes()` method:

```csharp
IPAddress ipAddress = new IPAddress( ipAddressControl.GetAddressBytes() );
```

Update: The VS2010 version of this code adds an `IPAddress` property that renders the above unnecessary.
